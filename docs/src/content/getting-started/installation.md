# Installation

Nanyx can be installed on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The recommended way is through the `nanyx` version manager.

## Quick Install

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://nanyx.dev/install | sh
```

This will install the latest stable version of Nanyx and add it to your `PATH`.

## Verify Installation

```bash
nanyx --version
# nanyx 0.4.0
```

## Package Managers

### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install nanyx
```

### Linux (apt)

```bash
sudo apt install nanyx
```

### Windows (Scoop)

```bash
scoop install nanyx
```

## Editor Support

Nanyx has editor plugins available for:

- **VS Code** — install the `nanyx-lang` extension
- **Neovim** — via `nvim-lspconfig` with the Nanyx LSP
- **Zed** — built-in Nanyx support
