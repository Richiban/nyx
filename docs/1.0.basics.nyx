Basics

---


---
# Trying Nyx
---

println("Hello World")

---
# Expressions

Expressions are computable statement that result in a value

---

---
# Definitions
---

def message = "Hello world"

---
# Mutable definitions (variables)
---

mut counter = 0

set counter++

---
# Blocks

Blocks in Nyx use indentation. Default to two spaces

---

def message = 
  def preamble = "Hello"
  def audience = "World"

  "{preamble} {audience}"

---
In Nyx, any line that is more indented than the previous line is considered to be part of the same line

If the less-indented line ends with a `->` then the more-indented lines are considered a block.

It is permitted to "undent" a line (i.e. to write the line with less indentation than you would expect)
when the line line above is syntactically incomplete, such as with a dangling operator. Such a context
means that the next line is considered to be part of the same line, no matter its indentation.

e.g.

---

def message = "Hello " +
  "World"

---
# Commas

Commas are used to separate items in a list, fields in a tuple, or parameters in a function call.

You can use newlines instead of commas, where each item in the list or tuple has the same level of indentation.

---
  
-- e.g. The following are equivalent:

def items = [1, 2, 3]
def items = [
  1
  2
  3
]

def myTuple = (a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
def myTuple = (
  a = 1
  b = 2
  c = 3
)


---
# Comments

Single-line comments are started with two single quotes together `--`.

Multi-line comments start and end with a line containing only `---`.

It is common practice to write doc comments in Markdown format within a multi-line comment.

---


---
# Variables
  
Variables are defined using the 'def' keyword.

---
def name = "Fred"

---
Variables are, by default, immutable. If you need a value you can mutate you
can create a reference cell using the function `ref`

---
def age = Ref(21)

---
# Mutability

Mutable variables are specified with the `mut` keyword instead of `def`

---

def immutable = "Hello world"
mut mutable = "Hello world"

---
Note that immutability is a property of the variable, not the value. This means that the `mut` keyword
does not control whether the properties or contents of a value can be changed, but rather whether the 
variable can be reassigned.

`mut` can also be used in a type definition to make mutable properties

---

type Ref(a) = (mut value: a)

def myRef = Ref(1)
set myRef.value = 2

---
# Functions

---
# Literals

There are a few types of literal in Nyx. Some you will be used to, such as ints, strings and
bits.

---
def age = 21		--	int
def name = "Fred"	--	string
def factor = 1.5	--	double

--  Tags
def mode: #read | #readwrite = #readwrite 

--	Ranges
def range = 1..5
def fromBeginningTo5 = ..5
def from4ToEnd = 4..

def arraySlice = data(1..100)
def anotherSlice = data(1..)
def first5Letters = str.subString(..4)

--	Tuples

--	A comma joins two or more values together into a tuple. each member of the tuple can be
--  of any type
def things = ("John", "Alexander", 5, Uri())

---
Because Nyx supports union types a tuple can be enumerated. In the above example the
tuple "things" is of type (string, string, int, Uri), and can be used as a Sequence
of the following type -> Sequence(string|int|Uri).

---

for things
  | s: string -> println("We have a string -> {s}")
  | i: int ->  	println("We have an integer -> {i}")
  | uri: Uri ->  println("We have a uri -> {uri}")

--	Other literals might not be found in other languages, such as object literals.
def coordinates = ( x = 1, y = 2 )

--	Target-typed collection literals, defaults to List
def numbers = [1, 2, 3]

---
# Table literals
This is shorthand for writing a list of objects that have the same structure but
differing contents. Example:

---

def namesAndAges =
  [| name 		| age	|
   | "Felix" 	| 22	|
   | "Taylor" | 30	|
   | "Peter" 	| 28	|
   | "Sean" 	| 45	|]

--	This is equivalent to:
def namesAndAges = [
( name = "Felix", 	age = 22 )
( name = "Taylor",	age = 30 )
( name = "Peter",   age = 28 )
( name = "Sean", 	  age = 45 )
]


--  -- If-statements and branching --

--  If-statements

if cond ->
    some_code()
else ->
    some_other_code()


--  If-statements can have many branches, obviating the need for `else if` or `elif` chains
if | cond1 ->
        some_code()
   | cond2 -> 
        some_other_code()
   | else ->
        yet_more_code()
        

---
# Strings

Strings are one of the fundamental building blocks of a program. In Nyx there are two
main types you will be using: `nyx/String` and `nyx/StringBuffer`.

Note: `nyx/String`, like `nyx/Int32` is so common that it has a keyword for it built 
into the language. This allows you to use simply `string` instead, with no need to 
explicitly import `nyx`.

---


--  -- Operators --

Operator overloading -> while Nyx doesn't allow you to create your own operators, it has a list of operators that
are considered valid that you can choose from. Some of them are considered "spare", in that they have no pre-defined
meaning in Nyx, leaving you free to give them your own.

Primary example -> `->`

---
# Custom operators

You can define an operator in the same way as a regular function, but where the name of the function is the operator
you wish to overload wrapped in brackets. E.g.

---

def `=>`(a, b) -> ...


---
# Unimplemented code

You can use `...` to make code compile without supplying a body. 
It's a bit like `throw NotImplementedException` but will give a compiler warning.

---

def myFunction() -> ...

---
# Tuple unwrapping

Since there's no overloading in Nyx, tuples and tuple types get automatically unwrapped for you.
For example, `list((string, int))` can just be written as `list(string, int)`. In other languages
this would be ambiguous but in Nyx it's not.
