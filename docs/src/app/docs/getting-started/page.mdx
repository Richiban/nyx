# Getting started

Nyx scripts are small, direct, and easy to skim. Start by defining values, then
compose them with functions.

## A tiny program

```nyx
def message = "Hello Nyx"
def main = { message \dbg }
main()
```

## What to try next

- Add a record and pattern match on it.
- Turn the block into a function with parameters.
