# nyx

A toy (fictional) language and associated VS Code extension

## Features

Nyx is my attempt at creating my perfect language, in terms of what I would want it to look like as a user. It is a toy language,
meaning that it's not possible to actually compile or run any Nyx code; this is just me playing around with how I would like a language
to look and feel.

This extension gives basic syntax highlighting for the language.
