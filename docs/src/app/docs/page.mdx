# Nanyx Documentation

Welcome to the Nanyx documentation. This site mirrors the Gleam-style flow: start
with a clear overview, explore syntax and types, then settle into the patterns
that make Nanyx feel expressive.

## How the docs are organized

- Overview and quick start give you the mental model.
- Syntax and types clarify the language surface.
- Patterns and workflows show real-world composition.

## Next steps

- Visit the overview to get the idea of Nanyx in two minutes.
- Use the syntax guide as a reference while you read code.
