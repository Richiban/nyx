# Overview

Nyx is a language for clear, composable workflows. It leans on a small core of
concepts: functions, records, tags, and piping. The result is code that reads
like a sequence of transformations.

## What Nyx feels like

- Expressions are the default; blocks return the last expression.
- Records and tags carry the structure of your data.
- Pipelines keep data flow obvious.

## Philosophy

Nyx prefers explicitness over cleverness. Names are short, types are readable,
and workflows are designed to be traced.
