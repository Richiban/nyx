# Variables

In Nanyx, variables are immutable by default. You declare them using the `def` keyword.

## Def Bindings

```nyx
def name = "Nanyx"
def version = 4
def pi = 3.14159
```

Once a value is bound, it cannot be reassigned:

```nyx
def x = 10
x = 20  -- ✗ Compile error: cannot reassign immutable variable
```

## Mutable Variables

When you need mutation, use the `mut` keyword and `set` for updates:

```nyx
mut counter = 0
set counter++  -- ✓ This works
set counter = counter + 1  -- Also works
```

> **Tip:** Prefer immutable bindings whenever possible. They make your code easier to reason about.

## Type Annotations

Nanyx can infer types, but you can add annotations for clarity:

```nyx
def name: string = "Nanyx"
def count: int = 42
def ratio: float = 0.75
def active: bool = true
```

## Blocks

A block expression returns the value of its last expression:

```nyx
def result =
  def a = 10
  def b = 20
  a + b

-- result is 30
```
