Nanyx is an eagerly-evaluated language, but it does have some support for Laziness

By using a `where` block, you can define values that are lazily evaluated.  
The value will be evaluated the first time it is used, and the result will be cached for future calls.

def f() ->
  println(message)
  println(message) where
    message = "Hello, World!"
