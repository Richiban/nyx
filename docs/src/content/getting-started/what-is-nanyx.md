# What is Nanyx?

Nanyx is a modern, type-safe programming language designed for building reliable and maintainable software. It combines the expressiveness of functional programming with the practicality of systems-level control.

## Why Nanyx?

- **Type-safe by default** — catch errors at compile time, not at runtime
- **Pattern matching** — elegant control flow with exhaustive checking
- **Immutable values** — predictable code that's easy to reason about
- **Modules** — first-class module system for organizing your code
- **Fast compilation** — incremental builds that keep you in the flow
- **Friendly errors** — helpful compiler messages that guide you to a fix

## Who is Nanyx for?

Nanyx is designed for developers who want the safety guarantees of a statically-typed language without sacrificing developer experience. Whether you're building CLI tools, web services, or data pipelines, Nanyx provides the tools you need.

```nyx
-- Your first taste of Nanyx
println("Welcome to Nanyx!")
```
