# What is Nanyx?

Nanyx is a new programming language designed for simplicity, safety, and expressiveness. It features a clean syntax, powerful type system, and modern features like workflows and pattern matching.

It compiles to WASM, making it ideal for web development, but it's also great for general-purpose programming. Whether you're building a web app, a CLI tool, or a server, Nanyx has you covered.
